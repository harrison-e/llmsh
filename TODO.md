# To-Do 

- add input functionality (for interactive programs)
- add interactive mode (keep regenerating command until user is satisfied)
- add command blacklist (so that commands like `rm` require some sort of double check)
- command validation (make sure that commands are safe to execute and do not create breaking errors)
